Hi, I'm **Kristofer**, a full stack developer interested in the potential of web3, decentralised applications, regenerative processes, TypeScript, React, Rust, ICP, good UX, good DX, and lots of other things.

I am currently working for [Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/), building tools, demos, examples, and libraries for the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/). I also do developer advocacy around ICP concepts and technologies, such as Verifiable Credentials, Threshold Signatures, and Chain Fusion applications.

I have a side project! [Câ€“ATTS](Câ€“ATTS) â€“ Composite Attestations. Transform, combine, and migrate EAS attestations.

Previously, I have been doing work on other Web3 platforms such as [Hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/) and the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://easscan.org/) (EAS).

I used to be the co-founder and lead developer of [Praise](https://givepraise.xyz), a community intelligence system that promotes active participation and collaboration through peer recognition and rewards.
