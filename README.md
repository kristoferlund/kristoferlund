Hi, I'm Kristofer, a full stack app developer passionate about web3, TypeScript, React, Rust, ICP, good UX, good DX and lots of other things.

I am co-founder and lead developer of [Praise](https://givepraise.xyz/), a community intelligence system that promotes active participation and collaboration through peer recognition and rewards.

In addition to that, I build projects exploring the potential of web3 technologies. Lately, I have been doing some work on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) (ICP) and [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://easscan.org/) (EAS).
